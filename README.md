# BMW-Global-Sales-Data-Analysis-Using-Apache-PySpark
This project showcases real-world data engineering and analytics using PySpark on a large-scale automotive dataset spanning 2010–2024. The analysis was performed without pandas to demonstrate scalable big-data processing similar to industry practices used by automotive OEMs such as BMW.

The dataset was cleaned and standardized by resolving missing values, inconsistent formats, unrealistic engine sizes, abnormal mileage values, and issues specific to electric and hybrid vehicles, while maintaining data integrity. Advanced analytical metrics were developed, including year-over-year sales growth, demand indices, rolling three-year averages, price deciles, mileage bands and regional sales share.

Further analysis included cohort analysis to evaluate model age performance, price elasticity estimation, seasonality checks, and anomaly detection to replicate OEM-level analytics workflows. The project concludes with visualizations highlighting best-selling models, global sales trends and price distribution patterns, offering insights into BMW’s market evolution over time.
